# Piano Player

This is a simple piano player that can play notes from a piano keyboard. It is written in Python and uses the Pygame library for audio playback. The piano player reads a text file that contains a sequence of notes and their durations, and plays them back in order. There is also a MIDI converter that can convert a MIDI file to the text format used by the piano player. At the moment there are some limitations to the MIDI converter.
